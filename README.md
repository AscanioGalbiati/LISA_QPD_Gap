# LISA: QPD Gap Response Investigation

This Git Repository contains codes and lab scripts used to characterize a free-space laser setup and study the gap sensitivity of the Quadrant Photodiodes (QPDs) for the LISA mission.

- A numerical beam propagation model based on the ABCD law for Gaussian beams was implemented to establish a theoretical reference for the propagation of the laser beam along telescoping or collimating systems of lenses, which are used to couple the beam into a final objective lens with a very small working disntance.
- The laser was focused to the smallest experimentally achievable beam waist using a knife-edge (KE) technique, which exploits the gap of the QPD as a "blade".
- Using the beam size achieved with the KE technique, rasterized linescans were performed along the gap of Run1 and Run2 QPDs with straight ("+") and tilted ("x") orientations. For "+" QPDs hotizontal and vertical linescans were employed, for "x" QPDs four diagonal linescans were employed.
